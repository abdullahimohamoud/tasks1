# tasks1
This project is a simple task manager backend built with Python and Flask. It provides a RESTful API for managing tasks, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Tasks are stored in a local JSON file (tasks.json). The project is ready to be connected to any frontend or used with API tools like Postman or curl.
